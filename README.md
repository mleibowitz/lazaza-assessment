### LA-1234
**Title:** Implement the Image Upscaling Processor

**Description:** We need to create a processor that can take incoming image upscaling messages, upscale them using a 3rd party API, and submit them to our image service.  The following components have already been implemented: 

* Image Message Queue: A client to the queue is provided in src/clients/queue_client.py.  Instantiating “QueueClient” will create a connection to the queue and calling “pop()” will de-queue a message.  The message is stored and returned as a dictionary with the following attributes: 
    * width: int – the requested width of the image 
    * height: int – the requested height of the image 
    * image_data: str - base64 encoded string of the png image 
* Image Upscaler: An HTTP web service exists for upscaling images. To upscale, submit a POST request to (https://lazazaai00imgageresizer00.azurewebsites.net/api/upscale) with the following fields in the json body of the request 
    * access_token: str – the api access token provided to you 
    * new_height: int – the desired height of the image 
    * new_width: int – the desired width of the image 
    * base64_image: str – the base64 encoded string of the image 
    * **Response**: json, where the field “base64_image” is the base64 encoded string of the png image 
* Image Service: A service to submit the upscaled image to.  A client is provided in src/clients/image_service_client.py.  Instantiating “ImageServiceClient” will create a connection to the image service and calling “post_image()” will submit the image, a status code of 200 indicating a successful submission.  ImageService.post_image() takes in the image as “bytes”. 


The processor should utilize these existing services & clients to upscale images as it receives them from the queue.  The end result of this ticket is a python file, `main.py`, that when run will continuously receive messages from the queue, perform upscaling, and post them to the image service.  To verify output, we will run `python entrypoint.py` from the project root.
